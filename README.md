Rover: an SMS+Arduino electric fence controller
----
### Use text messages to control your :zap: fence.

Don't get zapped when you're out in the field and need to fix the fence.  Text
Rover and they'll turn it off for you.  When it's fixed, another text will turn
back on.  Rover can even text you when your power goes out, so you'll know when
your fence is down.
